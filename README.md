# UFOs
## Overview:
### In this module we are asked to create a website with the basis of UFOs. The website create using Javascript will allow for users to search UFO related info by searching different dates, cities, states, countries and shapes.
## Results:
### UFO Sightings:![FD9BCE9E-07FE-4D8E-9C79-0784770A4DE5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99035696/169733721-f90431f1-a044-4b60-b71d-cc5361a79eb9.jpeg)

### The module activity adding the additional filters:![EA59D282-11C4-4B7E-BF87-FEE7AB3EA145](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99035696/169733745-fa925bda-057e-4be2-a2b9-4825cdd2c687.jpeg)

### After using the filters:It did ask to delete the button section so I am not sure how the search filter is supposed to operate.
## Summary:
### There seems that I encountered a ton of bugs I am not sure to change the background to a darker color to have the words more viewable and without the button I am not to sure how the filter part would work.
