# UFOs
## Overview:
### In this module we are asked to create a website with the basis of UFOs. The website create using Javascript will allow for users to search UFO related info by searching different dates, cities, states, countries and shapes.
## Results:

## Summary:
### There seems that I encountered a ton of bugs I am not sure to change the background to a darker color to have the words more viewable and without the button I am not to sure how the filter part would work. I would recommend that when filtering possible to not be case sensitive.
